# Country Gardens( and my dog Patrick )
This piece was a lot of fun! Really liked the sound of the quick note chnages. It was really hard on the forth finger on the A string. The quick D to E was difficult to get right. Either my fourth finger would just miss all together or it didn't want to come off the string after being put down. Other than that though, I felt the piece wasn't too far out of my reach to play. That being said, though I can hit the notes, I am finding variance in how it sounds from try to try. I'm not sure what that is from yet but I'm keeping my eye on it.
