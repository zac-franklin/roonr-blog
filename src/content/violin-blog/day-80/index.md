# Blue Danube( St. Patrick's Day )
Back from Ireland and right into Saint Patrick's Day! Wanted to get a video out for the ocassion but the piece made me work for that. So, so, hard. And the hardest part was the most iconic part. So, it just stuck out even worse when I got something off. It's just all over the place. G string, and back again, a horror tale by Zac Pearson. I felt, and honestly still feel, like I'm just guessing and hoping during that first part with almost no confidence that it'll do what I want. Happy to know it though for practicing's sake.
