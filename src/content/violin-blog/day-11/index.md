# First Finger 
Left hand is on the move!! Slowly, but that appears to be the theme emerging here. Honestly, other than learning the new pieces, this wasn't too much worse than just open strings. I am finding it still incredibily difficult to play one string at a time. Also, jumping strings? Not a fan. It's so hard to keep the bow still as you fling the elbow up and down until it's at the desired, lone, string.
