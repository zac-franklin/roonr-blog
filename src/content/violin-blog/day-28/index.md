# Ode to Joy
My first real song! At least one that I know anyway. Really great to play something I could reason about by ear but also very humbling. To know how it should be played and then hear what was coming out of the violin... Helped me gain perspective on how far I have yet to go! I did not feel like the skill needed to play this peice was much more advanced than the excersizes leading up to this. So, that was nice.
