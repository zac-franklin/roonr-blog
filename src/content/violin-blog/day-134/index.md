# Air from Water
Fun piece but challenging with string switches. The whole piece wasn't too bad but finding the right rythm was hard for me. I think that might have contributed to the difficulty I had switching strings here. Similar to the last piece, this one also had fun runs but, after practicing it a bit, the runs here started to feel repetitive.
