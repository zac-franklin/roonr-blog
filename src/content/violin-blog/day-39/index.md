# March
So fun, so hard. The speed of this one was probably the hardest part, specifically that long run shortly after the rest. Going quickly from the E to the A and back to the E was hard and also the second finger jumping to the E string, what I am calling "behind" the fourth finger, was the toughest. When I have to move the third or fourth finger while I'm playing a note with the first or second, it's not that bad. But, moving the first or second to a different string while I'm playing a note on the third or fourth is much harder. Also, there is a spot there right after the rest where the second finger is now close to the first finger. That feels unnatural and was challenging to force the finger to be in that spot. Oh, and I could not get the quick string jumping at the very end for a while. I would just end up playing both the E and the A string together in a long scratchy spree. Such a fun piece though! I'll be using this one to practice I think for a while.
