# Open Strings
First exercise is open strings. First day with the violin and I haven't felt this uncoordinated in quite some time. Just play one string at a time bow, come on!! Thankfully, I have been looking forward to this moment for a while and that momentum is getting me through the day. Also, still figuring out the video recording software. The face really says it all, no prodigy here. Looks like we have a long road ahead!
