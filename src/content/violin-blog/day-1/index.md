# Open Strings
First excersize is open strings. First day with the violin and I haven't felt this uncoordinated in quite some time. Just play one string at a time bow, come on!! Thankfully, I had been looking forward to this moment for awhile and that momentum was able to get me through the day. Also, still figuring out the video reording software. Fingers crossed the audio and video are in sync for the next one. The face really says it all, no prodigy here. Looks like we have a long road ahead!
