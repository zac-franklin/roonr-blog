# Minuet in G
Most fun piece to play yet! I like all the runs and the small variations in them. Hardest parts here were not making that first note sound so flat and starting a separate down stroke while I am already playing one( the quick stroke almost at the end ). All around fun piece and a nice break from the past couple challening pieces!
