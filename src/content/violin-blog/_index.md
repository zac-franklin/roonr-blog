Hello! Thanks for checking out my violin blog. I am brand new to this, so bear with me. I'm mainly working through the excersices put together by [the Online Piano and Violin Tutor](https://youtu.be/iPbCdOsrDK4) but hopefully will be tossing in some fun one-off performances as well. I have enjoyed the journey so far, and hope you do too!
