Hello! Thanks for checking out my violin blog. I am brand new to this, so bear with me. Iâ€™ll be mainly working through the exercises put together by [the Online Piano and Violin Tutor](https://youtu.be/iPbCdOsrDK4) to start but hopefully will be tossing in some fun one-off performances as well. I have enjoyed the journey so far, and hope you do too!
