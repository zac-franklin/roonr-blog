# Second Finger
We getting some note variation now! Again, not too bad compared to the first finger and open strings. Hardest thing now is what to do with my bow hand? The pinky just feels awkward. And I guess I just leave it up like a fancy man drinking his tea? Can't be right. I have found until now that looking at the strings is easiest for me to play consitently OK. But, now with the second finger added in, I find myself wanting to look up at the neck.
