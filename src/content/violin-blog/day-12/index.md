# Lets go Round 2!
First finger exercises round two! I thought I could improve upon the long pauses from yesterday's performances but then, after messing up slightly in multiple takes, I decided to split the session into two videos. Thatâ€™s probably my main takeaway from this: After like two minutes my bow arm feels like jello. Any control I have over it goes very quickly.
