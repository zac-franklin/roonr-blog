# Lets go Round 2!
First finger excersizes round two! I thought I could improve upon yesterdays performance's long pauses for reading/mentally prepping. Then, after a couple tries and messing up right at the end, I decided to split the session into two videos. And that's my main take away, after like two minutes my bow arm feels like jello. Any control I have over it to start goes very quickly.
