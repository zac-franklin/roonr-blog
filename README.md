Welcome! This repository contains the files and discussions related to
my blog, [roonr](https://roonr.com). The blog will mainly walk through dev projects but will
also get updated with writing projects and random thoughts from time to
time. The dev posts will most likely revolve around Rust as that is
where my passion lies. However, I also like to do a bit of DevOps and
image processing work. So, blog posts in those fields may get sprinkled
in throughout! I welcome feedback of any kind but please be respectful
and follow [Rust's Code of
Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)!

This blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org)! I highly, highly
recommend for anyone looking to build a static site.
